<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a well documented and commented collection of Computer Fundamentals (Data Structure and Algorithm) written in languages such as C, C#, PHP, Python, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript and so on.

### Built With

This collection is built with love by me and other contributors. Thanks.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
